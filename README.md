Cave Report Form
==============

The intention of this repository is to created an online report form that may be used by anyone in the world to help record caves. Furthermore, the report form was made to improve functionality and make it as easy as possible to do what it is best at, recording caves. I am making this public to help others and hopefully improve upon the design and functionality of the form. 

In order to improve the ease of learning, I decided to include documentation in the docs/ directory. In that directory it contains an ERD, Entity-Relationship Diagram, of the database schema and a data dictionary for explanation of the fields. My plan is to create more documentation about the form to make the gap of learning how to implement or develop for it a breeze.
